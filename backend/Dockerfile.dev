# 1. Install System Dependencies First (Changes Rarely)
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    libpq-dev \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# 2. Use Cache Mount for Pip (Speeds up dependency changes)
# To use the --mount syntax, ensure you have BuildKit enabled.
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip \
    pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Setup Playwright (Fixed version to avoid re-downloads)
# Use a specific path so browsers are easy to find and cache
ENV PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH=/ms-playwright
RUN playwright install chromium && playwright install-deps

# 4. Copy Source Code Last (Changes most frequently)
# This prevents code edits from triggering pip installs or browser downloads
COPY . .
